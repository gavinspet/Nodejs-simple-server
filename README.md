How to create a simple Node.js server:

- You need Node.js to be installed on your system. 
- You can download Node.js and follow the instructions on how to do that on nodejs.org; 
- Clone or download this repository;
- Open your terminal; 
- With the command line go to the folder you just cloned/downloaded; 
- Type 'node index.js', so your server start running; 
- Go to the browser and access http://localhost:3000 

- http://localhost:3000         --> home page 
- http://localhost:3000/about   --> about page 
- http://localhost:3000/contact --> contact page 
- http://localhost:3000/xyz     --> "404:error page not found" 
                                (for any other page in the same port and localhost)
